# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges? 
1. It was tough but extremely helpful having teammates to bounce ideas off and to catch small errors andtalk out the process and and how we are changing the outputs
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
2.  Workflow is a little slow because I need to work on my typing and keyboard shortcuts. While slow I am staying focused to ensure I do not fall behind.
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
3. Talk things out and there are no bad ideas, additionally sometimes just becuase a solution looks simple does not mean it is incorrect.
